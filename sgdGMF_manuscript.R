# ----------- Arigoni benchmark

# First, the raw data of all celltypes is merged together in one file, and 
# an initial quality control is done.
source("Benchmarking/Arigoni/preprocessing.R")

# Then, the data is additionally filtered. For example, PBMC cells are not used
# and cells with many mitochondrial reads are removed.
source("Benchmarking/Arigoni/Data_preparation.R")

# We calculate a scree-plot based on the eigenvalues for the model selection.
source("Benchmarking/Arigoni/Eigenvalues_model_selection.R")

# We also perform cross-validation based on model selection criteria and 
# out of sample deviances to select the number of latent factors.
source("Benchmarking/Arigoni/sgdGMF-cv.R")

# sgdGMF estimation is performed using the optimal number of latent factors
# chosen in the cross-validation.
source("Benchmarking/Arigoni/sgdGMF-fitting.R")

# Benchmarking with glmPCA and NewWave is done. Here, these models are 
# used to perform dimensionality reduction on the Arigoni dataset.
source("Benchmarking/Arigoni/NewWave_comparison.R")

# We here group all results in data.frames that can be used to make the plots
# of the manuscript.
source("Benchmarking/Arigoni/Figure_preparation.R")

# We here construct the plots of the manuscript.

# ----------- CaseStudy benchmark

# First, the dataset is downloaded and quality control is performed to
# remove aberrant samples or genes.
source("Benchmarking/CaseStudy/TENxBrainData_Processing.R")

# The variance of each gene is estimated to select the most variable
# genes of the dataset. These genes will be further used in the decomposition.
source("Benchmarking/CaseStudy/High_variable_genes.R")

# We calculate a scree-plot based on the eigenvalues for the model selection.
source("Benchmarking/CaseStudy/Model_selection_eigenvalues.R")

# sgdGMF estimation is performed using the optimal number of latent factors
# estimated with the scree plot.
source("Benchmarking/CaseStudy/CaseStudy_Model_fitting_full.R")

# For the comparisons of the time-usage, sgdGMF is also run on smaller 
# parts of the data. Here, 5 times, the time is measured to compute the 
# dimensionality reduction for 100.000, 200.000 and 300.000 cells in this 
# dataset. This is also done for glmPCA with Avagrad estimation and with Fisher 
# estimation. Also, NewWave is used on the subsampled dataset. However, as 
# NewWave couldn't be run 5 times within the limited computing time (72 hours),
# it was run in 5 different scripts for each subsampled dataset.
